					<h1>About Me</h1>
				</header>
				<p>My name is William Ozeas, and I'm a recently graduated game developer who studied Computer Science and Music Composition with a minor in Game Design at Carnegie Mellon University. I have a deep education in computer science that lets me quickly learn new tools and concepts, along with experience in the arts that lets me work well with interdisciplinary teams. I have worked on over 20 games in my career, clubs, classes, and on my own time.</p>
				<p>I've gotten plenty of experience with gameplay, audio, and graphics programming. I have the most experience working in Unity and C#, but I've also made games in pure C++ and Lua. <br><br> For game audio, I specialize in FMOD middleware, although I've also experimented with making custom VST plug-ins for Unity with Max/MSP and RNBO. As a sound designer and musician, I generally use Logic Pro X as my DAW, but I also have experience with Ableton and Pro Tools. <br><br> My favorite games are Overwatch, Hollow Knight, Undertale, and anything by Supergiant Games. I'm currently playing Breath Of The Wild (very slowly) and Superliminal.</p>
