					<h1>About Me</h1>
				</header>
				<p>Hey! My name is Will Ozeas, and I'm a programmer and sound artist who loves to work on video games. I just graduated from Carnegie Mellon University, where I studied Computer Science and Music Composition with a minor in Game Design. I have plenty of experience with gameplay, audio, and graphics programming from the over 20 games I've created. I have the most experience working in Unity and C#, but I've also made games in pure C++ and Lua. <br><br> For game audio, I specialize in FMOD middleware, although I've also experimented with making custom VST plug-ins for Unity with Max/MSP and RNBO. As a sound designer and musician, I generally use Logic Pro X as my DAW, but I also have experience with Ableton and Pro Tools. <br><br> My favorite games are Overwatch, Hollow Knight, Undertale, and anything by Supergiant Games. I'm currently playing Breath Of The Wild (very slowly) and Superliminal.</p>
