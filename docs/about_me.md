				</header>
				<p>Hey! My name is Will Ozeas, and I'm a programmer and sound artist who loves to work on video games. I am currently at Carnegie Mellon University studying Computer Science and Music Composition. I specialize in audio programming, but I have plenty of experience with gameplay, systems, and graphics programming. I have the most experience working in Unity and C#, but I've also made games in pure C++ and Lua. For game audio, I specialize in FMOD middleware, although I've also experimented with making custom VST plug-ins for Unity with Max/MSP and RNBO. As a sound designer and musician, I generally use Logic Pro X as my DAW, but I also have experience with Ableton and Pro Tools.</p>
