						<h3>Aperture</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Built nearly from the ground up in C++ using OpenGL, Aperture is my most technically impressive game by far. In it, the player explores a small island, taking pictures of the native flora and fauna. As a programmer and sound designer on a team of three, I <b>implemented a texture pipeline</b>, <b>shadow maps</b>, <b>camera depth-of-field</b>, <b>hardware occlusion culling,</b> and other custom shaders, along with <b>game logic</b>, <b>picture grading</b>, <b>UI</b>, and more.</p>

						<h3>Dimensional Rift</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Dimensional Rift is my seventh game in CMU's Game Creation Society, and my first as a game lead (along with Adrian Ma). In it, one player navigates the world from a top-down perspective, while the other navigates the same screen as a 2D platformer. In addition to <b>managing, supporting, and supplementing the sound team</b>, as a gameplay programmer, I <b>implemented a versatile building placement system</b>, <b>a dialogue pipeline</b>, and more. As a lead I also had to <b>understand and integrate all the other members' code</b>, fixing bugs along the way. In the end, we won both the "Best Audio" and "GCS Gold" audience choice awards.</p>

						<h3>Assorted Minigames - CMU 15-466</h3>
					</header>
					<p>As part of CMU 15-466 Computer Game Programming, I built 5 mini-games in C++ using OpenGL. Each focuses on implementing a different aspect of a game engine; in order, <b>an asset pipeline</b>, <b>rendering 3D models/environments</b>, <b>audio</b>, <b>text rendering</b>, and <b>navigable walk meshes</b>. Then, we would use that new feature to make a game. Each project had a one week deadline, and the last two games were made on a team of three and two, respectively. The below links lead to the full code repositories for each game.</p>

						<h3>President's Cup 2022</h3>
					</header>
					<p>As a research assistant at Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center, I developed a multiplayer video game in Unity with Mirror for the 2022 President's Cup cybersecurity competition. I was one of five programmers and the only sound designer on a team of over 20. We designed minigames and an interactive spaceship. I personally worked on <b>game logic</b>, <b>state synchronization</b>, and designed <b>an audio manager with audio source pooling </b>in Unity, along with designing <b>over twenty sound effects</b>. </p>

				<div class="inner">
					<p>One of the game's main challenges was multiplayer networking, meaning we had to synchronize game state across multiple instances of the game using Mirror's synced variables and callbacks. The game was also built for WebGL, meaning we had to take care to adhere to WebGL's capabilities - including scrapping an FMOD engine and building my own using object pooling part of the way through the project. I also created over twenty sound effects for the game, many created from scratch and now released to the public domain.</p>

						<h3>Minion</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Minion is a procedually generated roguelike I worked on in Spring '22 in CMU's Game Creation Society (GCS) using Unity and FMOD. As Sound Lead, I focused on sound and sound implementation, where I worked with three other musicians to implement a <b>soundtrack that seamlessly transitioned between sections</b> when the player was in danger or a boss enemy showed up. I also created and implemented <b>over 20 sound effects</b> and did some bug fixing. This project won "Best Tech" in GCS.</p>

						<h3>Guilty Goose</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Guilty Goose is a bird fighting game I worked on in Spring '22 in CMU's Game Creation Society (GCS). As Sound Lead, I implemented a few <b>sound effects</b> in Unreal Engine with FMOD and wrote some <b>metal music</b> for the soundtrack. I also implemented a <b>system in FMOD where an audience would clap to the music when a combo happened</b> and cheer when it finished, but it was not added to the game due to the combo system not being finished. This project won "Best Sound" in GCS.</p>

						<h3>Haunted</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Haunted is a VR horror game where the only way to die is to flinch. As the solo audio person on a team of over 20, I <b>implemented 42 sound effects</b> in FMOD (using Google Resonance) and Unity/C#. These sounds included <b>voice-over</b> and an <b>adaptive piano instrument</b> that generated progressively frantic music the faster an object moved. This game was created in Fall '21 as part of the Game Creation Society (GCS) at CMU.</p>

						<h3>polyrhythm</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Polyrhythm is a rhythm game where instead of reacting to incoming notes, the player listens and detects patterns to proceed. As my first solo project, I created a <b>fully adaptive soundtrack</b> with a <b>mapping pipeline from FMOD to Unity</b> that included note visuals and color palette transitions, along with the <b>UI</b>, <b>visuals</b>, <b>game logic</b>, and rest of the game.</p>

						<h3>Death Road To Doggie Town</h3>
					</header>
					<p>For my first game jam, I joined the Game Maker's Toolkit Jam with two artists and one programmer I had never met before, and we created this infinite runner where you ride a skateboard attached to a chihuahua as you run away from a horde of zombies. I <b>wrote the soundtrack</b> and <b>designed/implemented the sound effects</b> in FMOD and Unity. I also served as a gameplay programmer, <b>implementing the infinite road generation</b> and <b>UI</b>. We placed 442nd in presentation out of 5,755 submissions, and 1,481st overall.</p>

						<h3>Escape From Lab 8</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Escape From Lab 8 is a procedurally generated roguelike made in Spring of '21 and my third game in CMU's Game Creation Society. In it, I found my niche as an audio implementation specialist, although I also did a decent amount of gameplay programming. I created the <b>procedural animation system</b> and <b>built on weapon code</b>. It was my first full game using FMOD with Unity, and I implemented <b>an adaptive soundtrack</b> using layering and <b>over 35 sound effects</b> from scratch, many of which were adaptive. This game won the "GCS Gold" award for audience choice.</p>

						<h3>Zombox</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Zombox is an isometric zombie shooter inspired by the game "Boxheads" that I worked on in Fall '20 in CMU's Game Creation Society. It was a great learning experience - from my first ever sound design, to my first time collaborating on music, to having to pivot from audio to a main programmer due to many members leaving the project - so while I'm not super proud of the final product, it set me up for success in the future in audio and programming. Plus, I made a <b>cool boss intro</b>, so it's not all terrible!</p>

						<h3>12 Years A Student</h3>
					</header>
					<p>My first full video game, 12 Years A Student, was completed at the COSMOS UCSC summer camp in 2018. Despite our team of 4 having almost no Unity experience, we managed to put together a decent task management game in a week and a half while having a lot of fun. I was most proud of my <b>homework problem generation</b> and <b>homework UI</b>, although I also worked on many other areas. This experience taught me how much I loved making games and makes me smile to this day.</p>
