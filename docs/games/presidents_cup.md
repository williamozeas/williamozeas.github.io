			<h2>Cubespace - President's Cup</h2>
		</header>
		<p>As a research assistant at Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center, I developed a multiplayer video game in Unity with Mirror for the 2022 President's Cup cybersecurity competition for federal employees. I was one of five programmers and the only sound designer on a team of over 20. We designed minigames and an interactive spaceship that were used as an environment for delivering the competition's cybersecurity challenges, which were developed by CMU's Software Engineering Institute in conjunction with the US Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency.</p>
		<!-- -->
		<p>One of the game's main challenges was multiplayer networking, meaning we had to synchronize game state across multiple instances of the game using Mirror's synced variables and callbacks. The game was also built for WebGL, meaning we had to take care to adhere to WebGL's capabilities - including scrapping an FMOD engine and building my own using object pooling part of the way through the project. My main programming work was in the various interactive workstations around the ship, but I also worked a bit with synchronizing state across the multiplayer instances and various other tasks. I also created over twenty sound effects for the game, many created from scratch and now released to the public domain.</p>
